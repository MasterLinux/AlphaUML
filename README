AlphaUML is an UML editor for Java written in JavaScript with the help of the Dojo Toolkit - http://dojotoolkit.org/ - and Adobe Air. 

It provides the following features:

- optimized for the Java programming language
- round-trip engineering
  * forward engineering & reverse engineering
  * not really round-trip, caused by my self-written Java parser grammar ;)
  * client-side java parsing with the help of pegjs 
     -> see https://github.com/dmajda/pegjs 
- an integrated source code editor with syntax highlighting
  * see Ace https://github.com/ajaxorg/ace
  * for editing source files in the UML editor
- file system access via Adobe Air
  * see http://www.adobe.com/devnet/air.html
  * only used to get access to the file system 
    and for providing a client-side web-app
- single page web app
- completely written in JavaScript
  * object-oriented  
- development focus to be a fully web app
